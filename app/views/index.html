      <p>
        Use this service to make a claim to an employment tribunal when you think an employer, potential employer,
        trade union or person at work has treated another person unlawfully.

        text: "During the employment tribunal process the organisations or people you're making a claim against are known as ‘respondents’."
      }) }}

          To make a claim you need to contact Acas and get an ‘Early conciliation certificate’ from them or give us a valid reason why you do not have one.
           If you do not have a certificate or a reason you need to <a class="govuk-link--no-visited-state" href="#">contact Acas.</a>
        </strong>

      <p>
        You do not have to make your claim in one go. You can save and return to it at any time before you submit it.
      </p>

        <strong class="govuk-warning-text__text">
          <span class="govuk-warning-text__assistive">Warning</span>
          Claims usually have to be made within 3 months of employment ending or problems happening. If a claim is late, you must explain why. A judge will then decide what happens next.
