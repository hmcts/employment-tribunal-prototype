        Do you have a valid reason why you do not have an ‘Acas early conciliation certificate’?

        Under certain circumstances you can make a claim without an Acas early conciliation certificate.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">One of the following reasons (or ‘exemptions’) will cover your specific circumstances and explain why you do not need a certificate for a respondent:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>You’re making a claim with another person who already has an Acas early conciliation number </li>
          <li>Acas do not have the power to provide early conciliation on some or all of your claim </li>
          <li>The organisations or people you’re making a claim against has already been in touch with Acas  </li>
          <li> You’re making an unfair dismissal claim which contains an application for ‘interim relief’ - this is rare and only applicable for certain reasons such as trade union activities, acting as a workers' representative or dismissal arising from whistleblowing </li>
